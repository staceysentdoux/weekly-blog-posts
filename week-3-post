Reading: 
  The Underwood reading was mind-blowing to say the least. 
  I was kicking myself so many times and wished I had read this in my first year of uni, instead of my last term! 
  Being in COMS, the essays we are required to write are endless, and the research can often be on topics that are fairly new.
  Hence, making the research extra tedious. It was definitely like a Boolean fishing expedition like Underwood says. 
  Learning about how we should know about the behind the scenes work of the algorithms really 
  made me realize how much effort and thought goes into researching materials,
  but also making the materials researchable as well. 
 Additionally, laying out the steps needed to fit a topic model for a collection of documents, 
 really impressed me as I never knew these 'models' were even a thing.
