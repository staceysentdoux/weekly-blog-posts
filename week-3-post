Reading: 
  The Underwood reading was mind-blowing to say the least. 
  I was kicking myself so many times and wished I had read this in my first year of uni, instead of my last term! 
  Being in COMS, the essays we are required to write are endless, and the research can often be on topics that are fairly new.
  Hence, making the research extra tedious. It was definitely like a Boolean fishing expedition like Underwood says. 
  Learning about how we should know about the behind the scenes work of the algorithms really 
  made me realize how much effort and thought goes into researching materials,
  but also making the materials researchable as well. 
 Additionally, laying out the steps needed to fit a topic model for a collection of documents, 
 really impressed me as I never knew these 'models' were even a thing. 
 
 In the first exercise, I was able to piece together what Underwood meant about these databases and algorithms. 
 Additionally, how much work goes into making the information discoverable. 
 I searched my last name in the CWGC, but to no results. 
 I figured it could be the fact that my last name has been edited over many generations in the past. 
 Then I searched up my brother in law's surname plus New Zealand which is where he's from. 
 It brought up 5 results. 
 However, since I don't know their family history I'm not sure if any of the 5 are related to my brother in law.
 I then entered France for the EDH, and was actually laughing at how the "simple search" has so many search options to narrow down, 
 and the advanced search had even more! 
 
 Started on exercise 2, and felt defeated. After completing step 1, my mind became like slush, and I felt a migraine coming on.
 So I stopped for a while to have lunch.
