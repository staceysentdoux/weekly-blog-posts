<p>Reading:<br>
Data can definitely get super messy, and it would make sense why many historians rarely discuss it. I feel that no one ever wants to speak out about things when it gets messy, people often want to solve or clean it up and then forget about the messiness. I do not really recall doing data cleaning in any of my other classes, but I have cleaned data on my personal machines, or even helped my mother with her business in cleaning and sorting out old files and documents. I have often found, especially when there is a large amount of data and files, in the whole chaos of cleaning the mess, sometimes files that are not incredibly important gets lost or hidden. Often times, I did not realize that I needed those files until a while down the road when I need them and then panic as I could not find them.</p>
<p>Exercises:</p>
<p>Manange to complete the Regex exercise with much more ease than last week’s module. It was so easy to clean and arrange data using it via DHbox. I could not imagine having to go through all those documents in a different way. Following the steps really helped me push through this exercise, and it opened my eyes to how messy data can be. Even just ‘cutting’ out had took me a while to scroll down till I found the last letter that was to be included.</p>
<p>The second exercise however is where I got stuck. I tried to download Open Refine and it downloaded on my Macbook but I could not open the app. I tried multiple times to edit my security preferences but it would not work. I had reached out on Slack, and hoping to hear back soon. I am currently in Singapore and just arrived today, having to handle my late father’s estate following his death in March. Hence, I am going to submit my work just in case I do not hear back before the due date, especially with the time difference as I may be asleep before I hear back, the jet lag is crazy!.</p>
